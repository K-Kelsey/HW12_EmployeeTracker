## Installation
To install this app so that it functions properly, clone my github repository, open the integrated terminal tied to the current project folder, then run 'npm install' in your terminal. This should download all necessary packages. Then in the db folder's intergrated terminal, sign in to your sql interface; source both the schema and seeds folder. Your database is now pre-populated.

## Usage
You can use this project to allow users to add new departments, roles, and employees to a database. These can be used to help sort and find employees based on department, role or manager names.

## Example
Here you can see some key elements within the code, that ensures that these objects are possible to create, that the path is being directed to the right location and how the these different data tables relate to one another:
